A bookshop-themed web application that recommends books using content-based filtering.  

Users can enter any book title to get suggestions based purely on content similarity, rather than crowd preferences or historical ratings.  

The recommendation engine is built on a dataset of 7,000 books, using TF-IDF vectorization of book descriptions (after experimenting with Bag of Words) to create a cosine similarity matrix that powers all recommendations.  

When a user searches for a book not in the database, its description is fetched from the Google Books API, vectorized, and compared against the existing matrix, effectively solving the cold start problem.
